                <p>Though there is not a whole lot of snow on the ground or in the short-term forecast at the moment, Danny Hogan and I are so
                    excited to launch our weather website. We'll be posting weekly forecasts on Thursdays (and potentially more frequently if
                    something particularly exciting is happening). We'll also be building out the Model Tools pages to be a one-stop-shop for 
                    models and observations for your favorite backcountry zones.

                    <h2>Forecast Discussion</h2>
                    <p>
                      Through fits and starts, this ski season has struggled to find its footing. Snow coverage remains exceptionally poor.
                      Nearly all of Western Washington Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites are below 50% of median to date. The few exceptions
                      are the highest elevation sites abopve ~5500' that have seen some snow out of these recent storms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most of Friday through Saturday, Western Washington will be sitting on the southern edge of weak (AR1) 
                        atmospheric river while it makes landfall on Vancouver Island. Expect mild temperatures and some high clouds
                        with some precipitation across the far North Cascades. Any precipitation that does make its way south will bring 
                        with it high freezing levels (>6000ft), limiting any snow to the highest terrain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This all begins to change early Sunday morning as the subtropical moisture finally slides south, opening the door 
                        for more widespread precipitation across the WA Cascades. It gets even better though as a shortwave trough moves 
                        through late on Sunday, bringing with it glorious cold air. There is strong ensemble agreement for freezing levels
                        to drop around 3-6pm Sunday afternoon, reaching below 3500ft by Monday morning. Snow accumulation will be limited 
                        because of the timing of the cold air and the low precipitation totals (relative to Washington in Novermber).

                            The Baker Backcountry will likely be the snow total winner but with a current limited to non-existent

                        <p><strong>Monday-Tuesday:</strong> Precip tapers off Monday night into Tuesday morning across the mountains providing
                            a brief window to dry out ahead of the next system. Some of the coldest air of the season so far, freezing levels <3500ft.

                        <p><strong>Wednesday-Thursday:</strong> Both the ECMWF (European) and GFS (US) models bring precipitation with a 
                            sub-tropical moisture component, they differ greatly. The ECMWF solution is shorter-lived and less wet.

                        <p><strong>Friday-Weekend:</strong> Too much uncertainty to make a reasonable forcast. </p>

                        <p>Very high uncertainty past the 5-day mark, we'll have to wait and see if the ensembles can converge on one of the colder solutions.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Longer Range:</strong> If we want to play the 200hr+ fantasy land game, the GFS model currently
                        shows a monster trough, cutoff from mean flow at both the upper and lower levels of the atmosphere, with 700mb
                        (~10,000') temperatures below -20C. This would bring snow to Seattle if it validates but it is highly unlikely (<10% chance). </p>

                        <h3>Best Choice This Weekend: Washington Pass</h3>
                        <p>We will likely find ourselves in a pickle once again this weekend. Perhaps the only place with enough snow 
                            to ski without an inordinate amount of effort is Washinton Pass. However, if it receives enough snow to 
                            provide even half-decent skiing, WA20 and the pass will likely close again. Oh well... 🤷‍♂️

                        <p>The Tincan SNOTEL site near Alyeska currently has 55" of settled depth so...</p>
                        
                        <h3>Other Good Options</h3>
