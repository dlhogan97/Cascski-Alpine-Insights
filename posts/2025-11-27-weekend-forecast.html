                Welcome to <em><b>The Dendritic Growth Zone</b></em>! 
                </h2>
                <h3> What is the Dendritic Growth Zone? </h3>
                The Dendritic Growth Zone, or DGZ for short, is the atmospheric lay every snow lover's dreams.
                It's where the temperature and humidity are <em>just</em> right to form large, low-density snowflakes that produce
                the light, fluffy powder we all crave. Snowflakes that form in the DGZ tend to be the most dendritic, meaning they 
                have those classic, intricate branching patterns.The diagram below (called a Nakaya diagram) illustrates the conditions that different
                types of snowflakes form in. 

                We decided to name our blog <em>The Dendritic Growth Zone</em> because it captures the essence of what we love about forecasting in the PNW.
                This is a goldilocks region, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, but when it's <em>just</em> right, the snow can be truly unbeatable!

                <h3> Forecast Discussion</h3>
                <p> 
                    Happy Thanksgiving weekend, everyone! We hope you had a wonderful holiday filled with good food, great company, 
                    and maybe even some time on the slopes. A productive week of winter weather brought 6–12 inches of settled snow 
                    across all forecast areas, aided by cold easterly flow as last week’s low pressure system moved inland. Today, a 
                    low spinning off the Washington–Oregon coast is pushing a warm front across the region, raising snow levels to
                     around 5,000–6,000 ft and keeping precipitation mostly as rain outside the higher terrain. As the cold front 
                     follows tonight into Friday, steady precipitation continues, but temperatures at the passes remain the major 
                     forecast challenge. Pass-level air is still below freezing, and the persistent “ice box” setup could hold long 
                     enough to support freezing rain before colder air fully scours out. 
                     
                     Heading into the weekend, a robust ridge builds offshore, shifting flow northerly and ushering in cooler air. 
                     A weak shortwave embedded on the ridge’s leading edge arrives Saturday, bringing another round of snow with 
                     generally good model agreement: most areas can expect 5–12 inches up north, with higher elevations seeing more. Stevens 
                     Pass currently stands out as the storm’s likely winner, with 5–15 inches possible. One caveat is that this shortwave is dropping in 
                     from British Columbia rather than tapping Pacific moisture, which could leave totals on the lower end. Behind it, 
                     colder air settles in for Saturday and Sunday, especially east of the crest. Meanwhile, a significant Arctic 
                     airmass is plunging down the eastern Rockies, missing the Pacific Northwest but setting the stage for frigid 
                     conditions in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.

                <h3>🚧👷Site updates and features coming soon👷🚧! </h3>
                <p> Our dreams of snow are finally coming together as our team is hard at work improving our site. 
                    We made some substantial changes this week! Most notably, we purchased the domain 
                    <a href="https://www.cascademountainweather.com/">www.cascademountainweather.com</a>, which is now
                    searchable on Google. We also improved our mobile experience, so you can check the forecast on the go!
                    Lastly, we added a few additional forecast locations and integrated meteorological station observations from each
                    site. These update automatically every hour.
                    
                    However, there is still much to do! We will continue improving the user experience with an emphasis on mobile
                    functionality. We are also working on adding new forecast graphics and interactive tools to help you plan 
                    your adventures. Finally, we plan to offer a forecast evaluation page to track how different models perform over 
                    the winter! 

                    Thanks again for visiting!
