<!-- Example summary fragment for `index.html` script.
     You can edit this file to set the latest post values. The script on the index page
     supports either a small <script> that sets variables (shown below) or simple HTML
     elements with ids: `post-tagline`, `post-date`, `post-summary`, and `post-href`.
-->

<script>
// Preferred: set variables (use valid JS strings)
var post_tagline = "Weekend of November 28-30, 2025: Thankful for Family, Friends, and Fresh Tracks 🦃";
var post_date = "November 27, 2025";
var post_summary = "A shortwave on the edge of an approaching ridge drops fresh snow with colder air to follow.";
var post_href = "posts/2025-11-27-weekend-forecast.html";
</script>

<!-- Optional fallback HTML fragment (the index script will read these if JS vars are not found) -->
<div id="post-tagline" style="display:none">Weekend of November 28-30, 2025: Thankful for Family, Friends, and Fresh Tracks 🦃</div>
<div id="post-date" style="display:none">November 27, 2025</div>
<div id="post-summary" style="display:none">A shortwave on the edge of an approaching ridge drops fresh snow with colder air to follow.</div>
<a id="post-href" href="posts/2025-11-27-weekend-forecast.html" style="display:none">link</a>
